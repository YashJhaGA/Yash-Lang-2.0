# Basic Information

Each program must start with 'START' and end with 'END'.
Each line must be terminated by a semicolon.
Each lexeme must be separated by a space.
So, something like 
```
int a = 5 ;
```
is valid while something like 
```
int a=5;
```
is wrong and will throw an error. 

# Data Types


int -> Whole Numbers

real -> Fraction/Decimal

String -> Characters of Text

boolean -> True / False

# Strucutres

If Statement and While Loop 


# Syntax

While Loop. Here you can iterate over a piece of code several times. The Syntax for a while loop can be seen as below

```
START
int a = 5 ;
int b = 0 ;
while ( a < 5 ) ;
b = b + a ;
a = a + 1 ;
elihw ;
END
```


For an if statement, you can make comparisons. Here's an example below

```
START
int a = 10 ;
int b ;
if ( a < 20 ) ;
b = 5 ;
fi ;
END
```


# Example of Code
```
START
int a ;
if ( 10 < 15 ) ;
a = 10 ;
fi ;
END
```

```
